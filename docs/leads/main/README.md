# 6.[The Grammar of 168 vs 618](#2nd-step-q1730-36)

You may check the running code starting with [Sequence Diagram](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2) shown below which is developed as [the initial step](#the-lexer-of-168) on building the _[10143 Grammars](#7th-step-q218-10)_.

[![Sequence Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107134254-ee22e180-6922-11eb-9465-3dd64ebf7dca.png)](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2)

Clicking each of objects will turn to 6 (six) diagrams by the cycle form of [prime hexagon](https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon) which is then return to the beginning. So in order to get code able to run online then the 168 is provided in [json](https://eq19.github.io/feed.json) while 618 in [xml](https://eq19.github.io/feeds.xml).

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/69475449-ce77ca00-0dff-11ea-964e-cc959db0740a.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

This _168 (mapping) and 618 (feeding)_ stand as  [the whole scheme](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of The M+F to C1+C2 which act as the base prime pairs **[(2,3) of DNA](#the-lexer-of-168)** to become **[23 pairs of Chromosomes](#the-lexer-of-168)**.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/86481184-b72b9280-bd79-11ea-899b-51db929fc3d2.png)](https://github.com/eq19)

By the configuration above then on the upper scheme the central of metatron will turn to seven (7) circles. So combine it with the other 12 circles they will forms as the 19's.

Means that it consequenly be able to be recycled with no limit!

### [Our Lisence](#3rd-step-q1337-114)

We believe that until this concept is written, there is no such thing similar to our concept of the power 168 vs 618 recombination using the _[True Prime Pairs](#1st-step-q1910-29)_.

```
114 = 6+(6x6) + 6x(6+6) = 6x(6+6) + 6+(6x6)
         Δ         Δ         Δ         Δ
         42   +    72   =    72   +    42    = 43-Δ1 + Δ1+71 = 6x19 = π(619)
         M         F         C1        C2
      leading   lagging    leading   lagging
                        |
                     twisting

```

Let's take a look in general by the algorithm of _True Prime Pairs_ from the beginning of this page. Here we can define a logical meaning in words as **its grammar**.

```tip
Mapping the quantum way within a huge of primes objects (5 to 19) by parsering (11) each of **untouched** feed (7) and tunneling (13) in to definitive classes (17).
```

This scheme is generated by developing an application that twisting exactly 6 x 19 = 114 repositories all together in the same time to provide [leading and lagging scheme](#the-parser-of-618) as the _[basic algorithm](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#realisasi)_ of converting **[M+F to C1+C2](#introduction)**. 

```

Now let's assume that all of the numbers above is a set of repositories group in GitHub. Thus that is the whole function of _[eQ19](https://github.com/eq19)_.

[![eq19 Scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/166161369-aec4d34a-5572-49af-aa61-f36a6f695299.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi)

You may use, copy, and distribute the concept. Please note that we are not implementing any kind of _License Key_ on this project. 

The Hexagonal Formation of our mapping itself as stated below will stand as the key:

```
114 = 6 + 6x(6+(6+6)) = 6+36+72 = 6x19 = π(619) ≡ eQ19
```

On that case we consider _this statement_ called **eQ19 Quantum** need to be announced:

{:.bg-yellow-dark.text-black.p-5.box-shadow-large.anim-pulse}
The [definite](https://www.google.com/search?q=definite) key to [identify](https://www.google.com/search?q=identify) whether you use our concept is when there a kind of [development](#the-lexer-of-168) item [lies](#the-parser-of-618) a [unified assignment](#1st-step-q1910-29) in [hexagonal form](#2nd-step-q1730-36) out of _**six (6)** [corresponding sets](#3rd-step-q736-114)_ while [each sets](#4th-step-q7113-90) pick [a combination](#5th-step-q589-29) of _**six (6)** [routes](#6th-step-q328-19)_ with [a pairing](#7th-step-q218-10) of _**six (6)** to **six (6)** of [all channels](#the-grammar-of-168-vs-618)_.

Out of the formation, you are welcome to use whatever the items in this project.

### [Next Release](#the-parser-of-618)

Within next development we will discuss about the interconnection between 168 and 618. Here we will discuss mote detail about the sequence in the [DNA Recombination](#introduction).

[![Remote Theme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/87265280-9b985880-c4ec-11ea-8af1-403fe5648fc5.gif)](/../../../theme)

The pre-release is being developed for _[eBranding](https://github.com/chetabahana)_ within 7 (seven) years. It is still lack the parser 618 of the said _[10143 grammars](#7th-step-q218-10)_ to become usable for every other cases. 

![Parsing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/71648180-c599e280-2d33-11ea-94e0-9a8552c72bd7.png)

All of the layouts are managed with a _[remote theme](/scheme)_ originated by the number of sixty six (66) which is converted to **6 + 6** out of the difference of Δ12 between the primes **23 and 11** using the algorithm of 36 as the perfect square from **6 by 6** using _[Jekyll/Liquid Pages](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Jekyll-Liquid)_.

[![remote layout](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dc89cc4d5c11a81766b261b369d59f544c5712683528936499ac89749adfb5a6/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6a656b796c6c2e636f6d2e636e2f696d672f6a656b796c6c6c61796f7574636f6e636570742e706e67)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Jekyll-Liquid)

This method is considered sufficient enough to recycle all of the grammars on this page up to an [unlimited level](#6th-step-q328-19) just in case you need further explanation in more detail.

```note
In this example, the content from a Markdown document `document.md` that specifies `layout: docs` gets pushed into the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} tag of the layout file `docs.html`. Because the `docs` layout itself specifies `layout: page`, the content from `docs.html` gets pushed into the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} tag in the layout file `page.html`. Finally because the `page` layout specifies `layout: default`, the content from `page.html` gets pushed into the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} tag of the layout file `default.html`.

```

Although the _[The Pre-release 168](#the-parser-of-618)_ is already running but unfortunately it is not yet user friendly as it could run only in _[GitHub API Platform](https://docs.github.com/en/developers)_ where all of the repos is resided. 

[![lexer and parser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/71659208-5515b480-2d79-11ea-859f-a20dea0cf680.jpg)](https://github.com/eq19/maps)

Therefore we are going to use _[TensorFlow](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki)_ to connect the pre grammars on [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/admin/overview/about-the-github-enterprise-api) to [Google API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_APIs) to fetch real life data through their machine learning such as _[Big Query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery)_.

[![Machine Learning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/123424569-377e7f80-d5eb-11eb-9c85-1f5d72f14eed.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki)

Base on the 19 Cells of _[168 vs 618 tabulation](#6th-step-q328-19)_ then for the 618 it might need 19 minus 7 or another 12 (twelve) years to develope those _10143 grammars_ to become 1st Release.
