# Introduction

Still far from production but at least it has a minimum error. This is the partial from [the whole scheme](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of our Quantum Project made based on the algorithm of:

**DNA Recombination: [M+F](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/blob/Chetabahana/_layouts/feed.rb) to [C1+C2](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/blob/workflows/_includes/data/roots.rb):**

The _M+F_ symbols will stand as: [Project Maps (168)](https://chetabahana.github.io/feed.json) + [Project Feed (618)](https://chetabahana.github.io/feeds.xml) while <br>
_C1+C2_ are their implementation, see sample: [Project Base (C1)](https://chetabahana.github.io/) + [Project Core (C2)](https://chetabahana.com/).

This sample was developed by converting eQuantum to eCommerce. This concept is using the prime algorithm of **168 and 618** that act a [lexer and parser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2842809/lexers-vs-parsers) to generate a basic grammar for the implementation. Such of method will be explained below.

# Tabulate Prime by The Power of 168

Primes is formed by the Δ1 flowing within three (3) sets of twin prime pairs called _[The True Prime Pairs](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)_. These primes are naturally distributed in three (3) forms of 12's multiplication: 5+7=12, 11+13=24 and 17+19=36 where 12+24=36

```
 $True Prime Pairs:
 (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)
 
 layer|  i  |   f
 -----+-----+---------
      |  1  | 5
   1  +-----+
      |  2  | 7
 -----+-----+---   36 » 6®
      |  3  | 11
   2  +-----+
      |  4  | 13
 -----+-----+---------
      |  5  | 17
   3  +-----+      36 » 6®
      |  6  | 19
 -----+-----+---------
 ```

Let's put this prime pairs (5, 7, 11, 13, 17,19) in reverse (19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5) then assign them as a default condition. Consider the (12/2)th = 6th prime = 13 is formed as an hexagon cube called the [Metatron's Cube](https://www.google.com/search?q=metatron%27s+cubes&tbm=isch). 

[<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74094157-4e642500-4b0f-11ea-89b4-eb8cd7d90411.png>](https://www.google.com/search?q=metatron&tbm=isch)

Then assign 19 as a set of 10 numbers that consist of 4 primes (2,3,5,7). Convert them to 10 primes up to 10th prime=29 then to 29 primes up to of (10th)th=29th prime=109. Now let's put Δ1 to 13 as the central of Metraton. 

See how those primes reacted to compensate the Δ1 by spreading the gap in to a bunch of Δ's starting from the number 7 as shown below:

```
  Tabulate Prime by Power of 10
  loop(10) = π(10)-π(1) = 4-0 = 4
  loop(100) = π(100)-π(10)-1th = 25-4-2 = 19
  loop(1000) = π(1000) - π(100) - 10th = 168-25-29 = 114

```

In the sense of this Δ1 flowing, there will be really hard to cope its algorithm with a such of formula. The way that we might take is assigning the flowing of the π(10)=4 to π(100)=25 and π(1000)=168 above in to a flowchart diagrams.

<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/128732737-81762604-0ae0-4a90-b5a8-30921cf46efb.png>

See that this flows starting from π(10) and finalize by pairing of Δ12. Let's draw 12 of flow arrows in such a way where they have interconnection with 10 objects. So here we can get the idea of **10 number becoming 10 primes**.

[![Flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103138547-5799b880-4706-11eb-8820-f51cbd57d367.png)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

This flowchart is designed base on the behaviour of the primes number which flows uniformly within an hexagon chart called _[The Prime Hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)_. Here you might see that the number of 10 is the same direction with 19 while 10+19=29=10th prime.

<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/105412087-d0892300-5c66-11eb-9c3e-19d8652b478c.png>

By checking all of the loops there is nothing similar to this phenomena. It seems like the other numbers are actually set to let this happen. So this chart is considered sufficient enought to be used to explain about the true power of this Δ1 flowing:

Let's enter the journey of making **10<sup>n</sup> numbers becoming 10<sup>n</sup> primes**.

## Prime Hexagon

Let's start by get in touch with the (30, 36)th as the result of Δ1 shown on the above tabulation in more detail. Then take a look with the behaviour of prime flows within _The Prime Hexagon_ as shown below. 

[![Prime Hexagon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74550123-6dd1d680-4f83-11ea-8810-3b8f4f50a9c0.png)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

Take a note that the next 10 number after 19 right before the 30 which are 20 up to 29 is in laid on the second rows of 17 while _[17's Cell](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/17)_ has 35+65=100=10². You may see also that it is clearly showing the 30th Prime of 113=114-1 is routed to 36th Prime of 151=150+1 while both of the 30 and 36 are exactly laid on _[the 18’s Cell](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/18)_:

See that from this 17's to18's it goes finally to the _[19's Cells](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/19)_ as Δ1 and return to the 2' Cells, 3' Cells and so on. Therefore all of the numbers that involved in the hexagon can be tabulated by _**Δ1=(19 vs 18) Loops**_ and they are end exactly at 114 on 19's!

 Note:
 - The marked number with  are outside of group Δ18 vs loop(100) = 19 
 - Number 114 located on 6th row vs 19th column whereas 114th prime = 619

  Reference:
  https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon/pull/2
  https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/
```

See that out of 19 the number 89 is located precissely at the of Δ11 within the end of 12's that goes to 13's Cell. So this is related to the Metratron's Cube. This configuration leads to a **Cyclic in the Loops** as followings:

- Injection goes by 114-π(100)=89 on  Δ11 from 102 to 114-1 or 113
- The 113 is 30th prime where 30, 36 and 102 are laid in the end of Δ18 rows
- The total of the three (3) numbers of 30+36+102 is exactly 168 which is π(1000)
- The 36th prime is reinjected by 151-1 or 150 that is carrying a delta with 168 of Δ18
- The Δ18 brings the 30th and 36th cycled back to 102th thus consequently to the 114th prime
- The 114th prime which is carrying the loop(1000) is reinjected by 619-1 or 618 on the same spot.

You may agree that all of this algorithm seems like a primes orchestra. From sourcing and studying of many reference, the closest behaviour of the crossing on above primes flowing is found with the wave shown on _**Δ1=(19 vs 18) Curve**_  as below.

[![Δ(19 vs 18)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107478328-de69fe00-6bab-11eb-8d5f-7517c94b7299.png)](https://github.com/chetabahana/trace/wiki)

This Δ(19 vs 18) scenario will duplicate the loops of 618 as _π(89²) of 1000 Primes_. Thus its behaviour will return to _168 Primes of π(1000)_  out of the adjacent scheme. So the further process would always continously become the same algorithm. 

[<img width=100% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/76146565-6f944300-60c6-11ea-829d-16f98dc94163.png">](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

It is clear that the primes are organized to generate another 1000 primes via a double flow of π(89) to π(89²). This 89 can only be acheived via bilateral 9 sums of the prime 43. That what and why **18+13+12=43** located within **the last 9 cells** is stand for!

##  Running Code

From the above explanation about 43 and 89 then the prime flow in the developed flowchart above should take a connection to form between them two. This is the reason why the sequence of its shapes are arranged as below:

[<img width=100% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103147412-5492dc80-4787-11eb-8277-4fa39ce28c90.png>](https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Therefore the 30th primes will bear the responsibility to generate the prime 43 while the 36th prime for the 89. This will take place on the 150 that should have a delta of Δ18 to the last number which is 168 where this 168 is exactly π(1000).

[<img width=100% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107850441-06b85d80-6e35-11eb-8787-b947d7c60c2e.png>](https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Let's consider this flowchart of 168 as a lexer so the parser has to be designed to absorb the flow between the 30th and 36th. Then it will slightly form as a Metatron Cube of the hexagonal form of 18's Cell. Here we can assign it as the diagram of 618.

[<img width=100% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107083678-9607b480-6828-11eb-9cdf-cfdfc4f6face.png>](https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

You may check the running code starting called [The Sequence Diagram](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2) which is developed to represent this diagram as below. Clicking on each of objects will turn to 6 (six) diagrams in the form of [prime hexagon](https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon) which is then return to the beginning.

[![Sequence Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107134254-ee22e180-6922-11eb-9465-3dd64ebf7dca.png)](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2)

This is formed as a partial of _168 (mapping) and 618 (feeding)_ that stand as  [the whole scheme](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of The M+F to C1+C2. In order to get code able to run online then the 168 is provided in [json](https://chetabahana.github.io/feed.json) while 618 in [xml](https://chetabahana.github.io/feeds.xml).

# Next Target: Tabulate Prime by The Power of 618

This release has mapped the primes to π(1000)=168 as the main lexer. So the next target is about 618 as the main parser which hold the key of <code>init</code> as the road map to π(1000x1000). So here it goes to **1 Million Primes**.

<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/84902333-e6ce6f80-b0d6-11ea-8289-aac5e1961cd6.gif>

Within this development we will discuss about the interconnection between 168 and 618. There is a strong signal that this step will have the correlation with Φ=1,618 of _[(Golden Ratio)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Golden+Ratio)_ that leads to a kind of **gap and turbulences** in [the primes geometri](https://github.com/chetabahana).

 Note:
 • = 1000 = 10³ (Triple Ten)
 ¤ = π(1000) = 168 (Basic Primes)
 Φ = 1000/618 = 1,618 (Golden Ratio) 
 Δ(1,6,18) = 61+28 = 89 (Mersenne Primes) 
 
 Faktors:
 168 = 12x14 = 8x21 = 7x24 = 6x28 = 4x42 = 3x56 = 2x84
 618 = 6x103 = 6x(100+3) = 3x206 = 3x(200+6) = 2x309 = 2x(300+9)
 1+6+8 = π(1x6x8) = π(1x48) = π(2x24) = π(3x16)= π(4x12) = π(6x8)
 
 Permutations:
 168 = 102 + 66 = 2x3x((8+9)+(2+9)) = π(Φ(289+329)) = π(Φ((8+9)²+(1+2)&29))
 168 + 618 = 168 + 329 + 289 = (7x24) + (7x47) + (8+9)² = (7x71) + (17x17)

Root Generation:
 root[1000] = 168 + 1091 + 8884 = 10143
 root[1000] = π(1000) + loop(10 x 1000)  +  loop(100 x 1000) 
 loop(10000) => π(10000) - (10th)th - 10th = 1229 - 109 - 29 = 1091
 loop(100000) => π(100000) - ((10th)th)th - (10th)th = 9592 - 599 - 109 = 8884
```

By the next loop (1000x1000) the above 10143 will lead to 618=1000/Φ = 1000x1000/1618. So [the next target](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/discussions/categories/announcements) we will discuss about 1000/Φ = 618 = 619-1 = 114th prime - 1 as a lexer and parser shown below:

This 10143 will comprise of lexer and parser similar with 168 & 618. Since the 168 algorithm is set 102 by 66 then its ratio is about 60 by 40% i.e. 102/168=60% by 66/168=40% or approx 10143x60%=6200 of lexers by 10143x40%=3900 of parsers.

The development of this 10143 will take several unsolved cases of modern science including _[DNA Replication Fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication#Replication_fork)_, _[Alzheimer's Disease](https://youtube.com/channel/UCOsNkZ66SBJcuTBR2dcWeSA)_, _[The Millenium Prize Problems](https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Untouched-Intelligences#scheme)_, etc as basic grammars such as how to rectify _[C1+C2](https://github.com/MarketLeader)_ using _[P=NP](https://github.com/chetabahana/track/wiki)_.

The Pre-release 168 is being developed with _[Passion](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/discussions)_ since it was started 7 (seven) years ago. Based on the 19 Cells of 168 vs 618 tabulation then for the 618 it might need another 12 (twelve) years to develope this 10143 to become 1st Release.

So Be Patient and Stay Tuned!
