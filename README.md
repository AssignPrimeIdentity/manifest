# Introduction

This is the partial of [the whole scheme](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) from our [Quantum Project](https://github.com/eq19) based on the algorithm of:

**DNA Recombination: [M+F](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/blob/Chetabahana/_layouts/feed.rb) to [C1+C2](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/blob/workflows/_includes/data/roots.rb):**

[![eQ19 Project | GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/88602920-fd84c080-d09d-11ea-970d-dd63c12221fc.png)](https://eq19.github.io/)

The _M+F_ symbols will stand as: [Project Maps (M)](https://github.com/eq19/maps) + [Project Feed (F)](https://github.com/eq19/feed) while<br>
_C1+C2_ as implementations, see sample: [Project Base (C1)](https://chetabahana.github.io/) + [Project Core (C2)](https://chetabahana.com/).

This sample was developed by converting [eQuantum](https://github.com/eq19) to [eCommerce](https://github.com/MarketLeader) using the cyclic algorithm of **[168](https://github.com/eq19/quantum#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168) vs [618](https://github.com/eq19/quantum#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618)** that act as [Lexer and Parser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2842809/lexers-vs-parsers).

Each cycles will have a total of seven (7) steps primes algorithm of base 10 that consist of [three (3) leading steps](https://github.com/eq19/quantum#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168) of 168: Q(10, 30), Q(30, 36), Q(36, 114) and [four (4) lagging steps](https://github.com/eq19/quantum#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618) of 618: Q(114, 89), Q(89, 29), Q(29, 19), Q(19, 10):

[![Quantum Project - The Concept of Primes Algorithm by DNA Recombination](https://eq19.github.io/images/banner.jpg)](https://github.com/eq19/maps)

The final result of this Q(19,10) would form Ï€(10)=(2,3,5,7) as the [1st row of 19](https://github.com/eq19/quantum#1st-step-q10-30). Thus that is the actual meaning of _[eQ19](https://github.com/eq19)_.

Such of method is used to generate a _[basic grammar](https://github.com/chetabahana)_ which algorithm is adaptable for any kind of implementations or applications as explained below.


# Running Code

You may check the running code starting with [Sequence Diagram](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2) shown below which is developed as [the initial step](https://github.com/eq19/quantum#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168) on building the _[10143 Grammars](https://github.com/eq19/quantum#7th-step-q19-10)_.

[![Sequence Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107134254-ee22e180-6922-11eb-9465-3dd64ebf7dca.png)](https://chetabahana.github.io/#chetabahana-skema?pad=2)

Clicking on each of objects will turn to 6 (six) diagrams in the cycle form of [prime hexagon](https://github.com/chetabahana/hexagon) which is then return to the beginning. So in order to get code able to run online then the 168 is provided in [json](https://chetabahana.github.io/feed.json) while 618 in [xml](https://chetabahana.github.io/feeds.xml).

This is formed as a partial of _168 (mapping) and 618 (feeding)_ that stand as  [the whole scheme](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of The M+F to C1+C2. Although the code is already running but however it is not yet user friendly as it could run only in _[GitHub API Platform](https://docs.github.com/en/developers)_.

_The Pre-release 168_ is being developed for _[eCommerce](https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/discussions/70)_ within 7 (seven) years. Based on the _[19 Cells](https://github.com/eq19/quantum#6th-step-q29-19)_ of 168 vs 618 tabulation then for the 618 it might need another 12 (twelve) years to develope those _10143_ to become 1st Release.

So Be Patient and Stay Tuned!
